I'm a Ph.D. Candidate in Economics at **Boston College**.

My research sits at the intersection of **Macro-Finance, Financial Economics, and Banking**, focusing on critical topics like economic policy uncertainty, borrowing constraints, and supply chain disruptions.

With hands-on research experience at the **European Central Bank (ECB)** and the **International Monetary Fund (IMF)**, my work is driven by a commitment to empirical and theoretical research with direct policy relevance.

Take a look around to see my working papers, work in progress, and presentations!
